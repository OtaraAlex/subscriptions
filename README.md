## <a name="introduction">✨ Introduction</a>

Recurrly is a full-stack subscription management application designed to help users monitor and control their recurring expenses in one centralized hub. Built using a modern "Next.js-style" mobile architecture, the app features robust subscription tracking for both active and inactive charges, automated email reminders to ensure users never miss a billing date.

## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

### Frontend & Mobile
* **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)** is a powerful framework for building native mobile applications using React. It allows for a single codebase to run on both iOS and Android while maintaining the performance and feel of a truly native app.
* **[Expo](https://expo.dev/)** is the official framework recommended by the React Native team. It provides a robust set of tools and services—like file-based routing and EAS (Expo Application Services)—that streamline the development, building, and submission process.
* **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript. It provides static typing to catch errors early during development, improving code maintainability across the entire full-stack codebase.
* **[NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev/)** allows you to style your React Native applications using **Tailwind CSS**. It brings the efficiency of utility-first CSS to mobile, enabling rapid UI development with a consistent design system.

### Backend & Database
* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** serves as the cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes the backend service, providing high performance for asynchronous API operations.
* **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It serves as the middleware layer for the Recurrly backend, handling routing, API requests, and seamless integration with the database.
* **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** is a NoSQL database used to store user data and subscription details. Its flexible document-based structure is ideal for handling the evolving data needs of a subscription management platform.

### Infrastructure & Tools
* **[Clerk](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)** provides a complete suite of authentication and user management tools. It handles secure sign-ins, session management, and integrates seamlessly with billing workflows.
* **[PostHog](https://posthog.com/)** is an all-in-one platform for product analytics. It helps track user behavior, feature usage, and conversion rates, giving you the data needed to improve the app based on real-world usage.
* **[CodeRabbit](https://www.coderabbit.ai/)** is an AI-powered code review assistant. It provides deep, context-aware feedback on pull requests, helping maintain high code quality and catching potential bugs before they reach production.

## <a name="quick-start">🤸 Quick Start</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OtaraAlex/subscriptions.git
cd subscriptions
```

## Installation

 Before you begin developing your app, it's essential to set up Expo and initialize your project.
  - Start by creating a folder for your application. Then, open your terminal and navigate to that folder. To create an Expo app, you can use:

  ```bash
  npx create-expo-app@latest
  ```

  By default, you get a TypeScript Expo app with Expo Router configured.

  If you want a different starter (blank JS, blank TS, tabs, etc.), you can run:

  ```bash
  npx create-expo-app@latest --template
  ```

  And pick whichever template fits your workflow.

  Since this repository is already created, install dependencies and start the development server:

  ```bash
  npm install
  npx expo start
  ```

  `npx expo start` means "download (if needed) and execute Expo locally." It starts Metro Bundler, which compiles and serves your React Native code.

  Once it starts, you'll see a QR code and shortcut keys in the terminal. For example:
  - `a` opens Android
  - `i` opens iOS Simulator (macOS)
  - `w` opens web
  - `r` reloads
  - `m` opens dev menu in Expo Go / device context

  We don't need to rely on heavy IDE tooling to begin. The easiest flow is using Expo Go on your phone.

  Expo Go is a mobile app that lets you test React Native apps quickly by scanning a QR code. It's fast, beginner-friendly, and supports real-time updates while you code.

  Open Google Play Store or Apple App Store, install **Expo Go**, then come back here and scan the QR code.

  ### iOS VPN Turn OFF, and network permissions…

  Now open Expo Go and scan the QR code from the terminal. The app should compile and launch.

  If all is good, you'll see the starter app with two tabs: Home and Explore.

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content:


```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN=
POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```

Replace the placeholder values with your real credentials. You can get these by signing up at: [**Expo**](https://expo.dev/), [**PostHog**](https://posthog.com/) .

**Running the Project**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project.
